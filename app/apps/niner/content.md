## Why Niner exists

Most sudoku apps on the Play Store bury the puzzle under interstitial ads, "remove ads" upsells, and analytics SDKs that track every cell tap. The puzzle itself is fine. Everything around it isn't.

Niner is the opposite. A puzzle, a board, and the time it takes to solve it.

- **No ads.** Not even one. No upsells.
- **No accounts.** No login, no email, no cloud.
- **No internet permission.** The `AndroidManifest.xml` declares zero `<uses-permission>` entries. The app cannot make a network call.
- **No third-party SDKs.** No analytics, no crash reporters, no ad networks.

Your puzzles, stats, and achievements live in a single SharedPreferences file on your device. Uninstall the app and they're gone. No server-side data, no shadow copy.

## Features

### Game

- **5 difficulties.** Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert. Each has its own clue-count target and hint cap.
- **5 modes**
  - **Classic.** 3 mistakes, normal hint count
  - **Strict.** 1 mistake ends the game
  - **Coach.** Unlimited hints and mistakes (great for learning)
  - **Speed.** Countdown clock; every correct cell adds 4 seconds
  - **Killer.** Cages with target sums layered on top of standard sudoku rules
- **Daily puzzle.** One shared puzzle for every player, every day, with a 12-week activity heatmap and streak tracking
- **Per-mode-per-difficulty best-time tracking** + average win time + win rate
- **16 achievements** with bundled badge artwork

### Polish

- **Five hand-tuned colour themes** × light/dark variants (Ember, Electric, Neon Night, Citrus Punch, Hyperdrive)
- **Six celebration styles.** Confetti, Fireworks, Bubbles, Cherry Blossoms, Emoji Rain, Minimal
- **Wrong entries don't stick to the board.** They shake and vanish, so the board always reflects what you actually know.
- **Peer + same-digit highlighting** for quick visual scanning
- **Daily-streak heatmap** with empty-state preview grid
- **Animated mini-grid loader** during puzzle generation
- **Sequenced sound chimes** via Android's `ToneGenerator` (no bundled audio assets)
- **Loss-reason-aware celebrations.** Gave-up, mistake-limit, and Speed-timeout each get their own title, subtitle, and emoji.
- **Cage-aware hints in Killer.** When the cage constraint alone narrows a cell to one digit, the hint dialog explains in cage terms instead of pretending it's a regular naked single.
- **Optional auto rule-out.** Dims pad digits that can't go in the selected cell. Off by default, for pure deduction.
- **Tablet and landscape layout.** Board on the left, controls on the right.

### Accessibility

- **Colour-blind palette** option (amber for hints, dark orange for errors, dot pattern in the heatmap)
- **Large-text toggle** for cell values + notes
- **Centered-notes** layout option for users who prefer single-row pencil marks
- **TalkBack semantic overlay** on the board canvas. Every cell announces row, column, current value, and (in Killer) cage sum.
- **Light + dark mode** controlled by system or pinned to either

### Notable design decisions

- **No external state library.** ViewModel + `StateFlow` + `mutableStateOf` is enough for a single-activity Compose app. Adding Hilt, Koin, or Room would have inflated the APK with no real benefit for this scope.
- **`org.json` over `kotlinx.serialization`.** The persistence surface is small (saved game, stats, achievements). `org.json` ships with Android and saves an entire serialisation plugin from being added to the build.
- **Wrong entries shake but don't stick.** A wrong digit increments the mistake counter and triggers a board shake, but the cell stays empty. Removes the awkward "I see a 7 here but I know it's wrong, do I leave it?" loop.
- **Killer cages are strictly 2 or 3 cells.** Single-cell cages would double as pre-filled givens and dilute the Killer identity. Larger cages slow the solve loop without adding interesting reasoning. Strict 2- or 3-cell cages keep deductions tractable. A topology-trapped orphan triggers a regen rather than a 4-cell exception.
- **Killer uses fewer starting clues than Classic** at the same difficulty (32 vs 50 at Beginner, 17 vs 24 at Expert). Cage sums carry part of the deduction load.
- **The Killer hint engine is cage-aware.** When the cage constraint alone narrows a cell to one digit, the hint dialog explains in cage terms ("This cage needs 14. With 9 already in, the last cell must be 5") instead of pretending it's a standard naked single.
- **"New puzzle" generates fresh, never restarts the same puzzle.** A "restart this puzzle" button would let players pre-scout, then run again to fake a best time or unlock Perfectionist/Flawless cheaply. The overflow menu always ships a different puzzle.
- **Process-death restore via `SharedPreferences`.** Every cell entry persists the full game state to a single key (`saved_game`). `am force-stop` + relaunch lands the player on the menu with a Continue card pointing at the exact board they left.
- **Adaptive launcher icon** with dedicated `mipmap-anydpi-v26` background colour matching the splash screen, so no flicker on cold launch.

## Roadmap

Things deferred for v1.x:

- Smarter hint techniques (naked pair, X-Wing) for Hard / Expert
- Per-mode-per-difficulty win counts (the "Cage Master" achievement currently uses "won Killer at all 5 difficulties" as a proxy for "won 10 Killer puzzles")
- Localisation. Strings are inline; needs extraction to `strings.xml` first
